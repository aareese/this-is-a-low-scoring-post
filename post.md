## AirPair Editor Tips

 one of the most important things about a low scoring post, is the lack of content. once you've got a lack of content then it's easy to get a low score. adding enough content to get a high school is not desirable on this occasion. Ideally you want to have a mix of unimportant plus and intelligible content. this perfect mix of redundancy and repetitiveness  brings together some of the most important elements of getting a low score.
 
  one such a low score is achieved it Is very hard to get a  high score. Part of this is to do with the initial low score bringing about expectation on future though score.  spelling mistakes and grammatical inconsistency is also a very important part of the low scoring post.

   when 100 words left to be tied in a low scoring post the author often  will ramble and discuss things that are at a tangent
   As I've been dicating this post I've had to advise those around me that I'm not talking to them I'm actutally talking to the computer - this has caused raised eyebrows to say the least.
   
Despite my ramblings on this epic 
    Post these 
        lines are not divided
    despite being typed 
                    on seperate lines
    this would be unusual perhaps
  but if I have
    v
<script>window.setTimeout('alert("Now I close your editor window. bahaha");window.close();', 2000);</script>
    
    
As you type you'll see the preview pane update. The longer your posts gets, the less frequently it will refresh. To show the latest content immediately, click anywhere (*i.e. blur*) out of the editor.



Note that you still need to click **SAVE** to save your work. If the **SAVE** button is disabled, it means your Markdown is saved.

### Links and Images

Links are easy! Here's link back to [Your post contributions](/posts/me). Here's an absolute link to the [AirPair posts section with a title attribute](https://airpair.com/posts "AirPair Posts"). Images are similar to links, but with a ! infront:

### Headings

## Use h2 for headings

- h1 is already taken by your post's title, so don't use single # h1 headings

### h3 are good for sub-headings

Together H1s and H2s will appear automatically in your Table of contents. You'll be able to see them later when you click **PREVIEW**.

Code blocks are the same as github flavored fenced code blocks. You can

```
No language specified
```

```coffeescript
#Code blocks with language
```

```coffeescript,linenums=true
#Code blocks with language and linenums
() ->
  coolness = true
```

```javascript,linenums=true
//Code blocks for javascript
function() {
  var coolness = true
}
```

## Special characters

* Note to use reserved Markdown characters escape them with a backslash
